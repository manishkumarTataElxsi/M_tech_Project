You're aiming to automate the generation of Gherkin test scripts i.e. Behavior Driven Development(BDD) from an ADAS (Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems) user manual using a multi-agent system. Here's a breakdown of how you could approach each step and integrate them into a cohesive system:

Overall Architecture:

A multi-agent system is a good choice. You'll have specialized agents for each task, communicating and coordinating to achieve the overall goal. A central "Orchestrator" agent can manage the workflow and data flow between the other agents.

Agents and their Responsibilities:

Requirement Extraction Agent:
Input: ADAS User Manual (PDF, Word, or other format).
Process: Uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques like Named Entity Recognition (NER), dependency parsing, and semantic analysis to identify and extract functional requirements. This agent needs to understand the structure and language of technical documentation.
Output: Structured requirements (e.g., in JSON or a database). Each requirement should have a unique ID, a textual description, and potentially associated metadata (e.g., priority, category).

Gherkin Generation Agent:
Input: Structured requirements.
Process: Translates the requirements into Gherkin scenarios. This agent needs to understand Gherkin syntax (Given, When, Then, And, But) and how to map requirements to executable steps. It may use templates or rules-based translation.
Output: Gherkin feature files.

Missing Test Case Analysis Agent:
Input: Structured requirements and generated Gherkin scenarios.
Process: Compares the generated Gherkin scenarios against the original requirements to identify gaps. It looks for requirements that haven't been adequately covered by test scenarios. This agent needs to understand the semantic relationship between requirements and test cases.
Output: A report of missing test cases, specifying which requirements are not covered or are only partially covered.

Traceability Report Generation Agent:
Input: Structured requirements, generated Gherkin scenarios, and missing test case report.
Process: Creates a traceability matrix or report that links requirements to Gherkin scenarios and highlights missing test cases. This report can be in various formats (e.g., CSV, HTML, or a dedicated reporting tool).
Output: Traceability report.

Orchestrator Agent:
Responsibility: Manages the workflow, coordinates the other agents, stores and retrieves data, and controls the iterative process.
Step-by-Step Implementation:

Requirement Extraction: Focus on robust NLP techniques. Consider using pre-trained language models fine-tuned on technical text.
Gherkin Generation: Start with simple rule-based translation and gradually introduce more sophisticated techniques like template-based generation or even machine learning models trained on examples of requirements and their corresponding Gherkin scenarios.
Missing Test Case Analysis: This is crucial. Define clear criteria for what constitutes adequate coverage. You might use techniques like keyword matching, semantic similarity, or even more advanced methods like formal verification to ensure complete coverage.
Traceability Report: Use a format that allows easy analysis and tracking. Consider using a dedicated test management tool for better traceability and reporting capabilities.
Iteration: The Orchestrator agent controls the loop. It checks the traceability report. If missing test cases are identified, it triggers the Gherkin Generation Agent (potentially with refined input or constraints) to generate additional scenarios. This process repeats until the traceability report shows sufficient coverage.
Tools and Technologies:

Programming Languages: Python (with libraries like NLTK, spaCy, transformers) is a good choice for NLP and agent development.
LLMs : Gemini
Agent Frameworks: Consider using an agent framework like CrewAI.
Data Storage: A database (e.g., PostgreSQL) or a document store (e.g., MongoDB) can be used to store requirements, Gherkin scenarios, and reports.
Challenges:

Ambiguity in User Manuals: Natural language can be ambiguous. The Requirement Extraction Agent needs to be robust enough to handle this.
Complex Requirements: Some requirements might be complex and difficult to translate directly into Gherkin scenarios.
Defining Coverage: Determining what constitutes "sufficient coverage" can be challenging.
By following this approach, you can create a powerful automated system for generating Gherkin test scripts from ADAS user manuals, improving test coverage and reducing manual effort. Remember to start with a small, well-defined subset of the manual and gradually expand the system's capabilities.


Executing a project of this complexity requires a phased approach. Here's a breakdown of how to get started and iteratively build the system:

Phase 1: Proof of Concept (POC)

Select a Small Scope: Don't try to process the entire ADAS manual at once. Choose a small, well-defined section with a few key features. This will allow you to focus on core functionality and iterate quickly.

Prototype Core Agents:

Requirement Extraction Agent (Simplified): Start with basic NLP techniques like regular expressions or keyword extraction to identify simple requirements.

Gherkin Generation Agent (Rule-Based): Create a set of simple rules to translate the extracted requirements into basic Gherkin scenarios. For example:
Requirement: "The system shall warn the driver if the vehicle deviates from its lane."
Rule: "If requirement contains 'warn the driver' and 'deviates from its lane', generate 'Given the vehicle is driving on a marked lane', 'When the vehicle deviates from the lane', 'Then the system should issue a warning'."

Missing Test Case Analysis Agent: Identify the missing test cases using requirements and Gherkin test script

Orchestrator Agent (Basic): Implement a simple script to run the other two agents sequentially and print the generated Gherkin.
Test and Iterate: Run the POC on your chosen section of the manual. Analyze the results, identify weaknesses in the extraction and generation processes, and refine your agents.

Phase 2: Expanding Functionality

Improve Requirement Extraction:

Advanced NLP: Implement more sophisticated NLP techniques like Named Entity Recognition (NER), dependency parsing, and semantic analysis using libraries like spaCy or transformers.
Handle Complex Sentences: Address issues like complex sentence structures, negations, and conditional statements.
Requirement Structuring: Define a clear structure for storing requirements (e.g., using JSON or a database) with fields like ID, description, priority, category, etc.
Enhance Gherkin Generation:

Template-Based Generation: Use templates to generate more varied and realistic Gherkin scenarios.
Parameterization: Introduce parameters in Gherkin scenarios to handle different input values and test cases.
Context and Background: Implement the use of Background steps in Gherkin to define common preconditions.
Implement Missing Test Case Analysis:

Coverage Criteria: Define clear criteria for determining adequate test coverage.
Comparison Logic: Implement logic to compare requirements and generated scenarios, identifying missing or partially covered requirements.
Implement Traceability Report Generation:

Report Format: Choose a suitable report format (e.g., CSV, HTML) or use a dedicated test management tool.
Linking Requirements and Scenarios: Implement logic to link requirements to corresponding Gherkin scenarios in the report.
Phase 3: Advanced Features and Refinement

Advanced NLP for Requirement Understanding:

Semantic Similarity: Use techniques like word embeddings or sentence embeddings to measure the semantic similarity between requirements and Gherkin scenarios.
Coreference Resolution: Implement coreference resolution to handle pronouns and other references in the text.
Machine Learning for Gherkin Generation:

Train a Model: Train a machine learning model on a dataset of requirements and their corresponding Gherkin scenarios to improve the accuracy and naturalness of the generated tests.
Agent Communication and Coordination:

Agent Framework: Use an agent framework like JADE or an alternative in Python to manage agent communication and coordination more effectively.
Integration with Testing Tools:

Automated Test Execution: Integrate the generated Gherkin scenarios with a testing framework like Cucumber or Behave to enable automated test execution.
Tools and Technologies (Expanded):

Programming Language: Python (with libraries like NLTK, spaCy, transformers, scikit-learn).
Agent Frameworks: CrewAI
Gherkin Tools: Behave (Python).
NLP Libraries: spaCy, NLTK, transformers (Hugging Face),Gemini.
Machine Learning Libraries: scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch.
Data Storage: PostgreSQL, MongoDB.
Test Management Tools: Jira, TestRail, Xray.
Key Considerations:

Data: You'll need a good dataset of ADAS user manual text and ideally some examples of existing Gherkin test cases to train any machine learning models.
Evaluation: Define clear metrics to evaluate the performance of your system (e.g., precision, recall, F1-score for requirement extraction, coverage rate for test generation).
Iteration: This is an iterative process. Start small, test frequently, and refine your system based on the results.
This structured approach will help you break down this complex project into manageable steps and increase your chances of success. Remember to document your progress and findings along the way.





# Phase 1: Proof of Concept (Simplified)

import re

class RequirementExtractionAgent:
    def extract_requirements(self, text):
        # Very basic extraction using regular expressions
        requirements = re.findall(r"The system shall (.*?)\.", text)
        return requirements

class GherkinGenerationAgent:
    def generate_gherkin(self, requirements):
        gherkin = []
        for req in requirements:
            if "warn the driver" in req and "deviates from its lane" in req:
                gherkin.append("Scenario: Lane Departure Warning")
                gherkin.append("  Given the vehicle is driving on a marked lane")
                gherkin.append("  When the vehicle deviates from the lane")
                gherkin.append("  Then the system should issue a warning")
            elif "apply brakes" in req and "imminent collision" in req:
                gherkin.append("Scenario: Automatic Emergency Braking")
                gherkin.append("  Given an imminent collision is detected")
                gherkin.append("  When the vehicle is approaching an obstacle too quickly")
                gherkin.append("  Then the system should apply the brakes")
            else:
              gherkin.append("Scenario: Requirement not covered by rules")
              gherkin.append(f"  # Requirement: The system shall {req}.")

        return "\n".join(gherkin)

# Example ADAS manual text (very simplified)
adas_text = """
The system shall warn the driver if the vehicle deviates from its lane.
The system shall apply brakes if an imminent collision is detected.
The system shall maintain a safe following distance.
"""

# Orchestrator
extractor = RequirementExtractionAgent()
generator = GherkinGenerationAgent()

requirements = extractor.extract_requirements(adas_text)
gherkin_script = generator.generate_gherkin(requirements)

print(gherkin_script)


# --- Phase 2 additions (Illustrative) ---
import json

class StructuredRequirement:
    def __init__(self, id, description, priority="Medium", category="Safety"):
        self.id = id
        self.description = description
        self.priority = priority
        self.category = category

    def to_json(self):
        return json.dumps(self.__dict__)

class AdvancedRequirementExtractionAgent:
    def extract_structured_requirements(self, text):
        requirements = []
        extracted = re.findall(r"The system shall (.*?)\.", text)
        for i, desc in enumerate(extracted):
            req = StructuredRequirement(id=f"REQ-{i+1}", description=desc)
            requirements.append(req)
        return requirements

#Example usage of structured requirements
advanced_extractor = AdvancedRequirementExtractionAgent()
structured_requirements = advanced_extractor.extract_structured_requirements(adas_text)
for req in structured_requirements:
    print(req.to_json())
Explanation and Improvements:

Phase 1 (Basic):
RequirementExtractionAgent: Now uses regular expressions to find sentences starting with "The system shall". This is still very basic but better than just splitting the text.
GherkinGenerationAgent: Implemented simple rules to translate specific requirements into Gherkin scenarios. Added a default scenario for requirements not covered by the rules.
Orchestrator: Creates instances of the agents, runs them, and prints the generated Gherkin.
Phase 2 (Illustrative):
StructuredRequirement: A class to represent requirements with structured data (ID, description, priority, category). This is a crucial step towards better data management.
AdvancedRequirementExtractionAgent: Creates structured requirements from the extracted text.
How to Run:

Save the code as a Python file (e.g., adas_test_automation.py).
Run it from your terminal: python adas_test_automation.py
Next Steps and Key Improvements for Further Development:

NLP for Requirement Extraction: Replace the regular expressions with spaCy or transformers for more accurate and robust extraction. This will handle more complex sentence structures and semantic understanding.
Template-Based Gherkin Generation: Use templating engines (like Jinja2 in Python) to create more flexible and reusable Gherkin scenarios.
Missing Test Case Analysis: Implement logic to compare the generated Gherkin against the structured requirements to identify gaps.
Traceability Report: Generate a report (e.g., CSV or JSON) linking requirements to Gherkin scenarios and highlighting missing test cases.
Agent Framework: Consider using an agent framework for better agent communication and coordination.
Error Handling: Add error handling to make the code more robust.
Testing: Write unit tests for your agents to ensure they are working correctly.
This improved example provides a more solid foundation to build upon. Remember to iterate and gradually add more advanced features as needed. This simplified example is a starting point, and implementing a full multi-agent system with advanced NLP and machine learning would require significantly more code and effort.






I want to Automate the Gherkin test script Generation the ADAS user manual using multi-agent system and Generative AI:

Step1: requirements generation from ADAS user manual

Step2: Gherkin test script generation



Automating Gherkin test script generation from an ADAS user manual using a multi-agent system and generative AI involves combining the strengths of both approaches. Here's a refined approach focusing on integrating generative AI:

Architecture:

We'll still use a multi-agent system for organization and workflow, but we'll leverage generative AI models (like large language models - LLMs) for the more complex tasks of requirement understanding and Gherkin generation.

Agents and their Responsibilities:

Document Processing Agent:

Input: ADAS User Manual (PDF, Word, etc.).
Process: Converts the manual into plain text. Handles document formatting and structure.
Output: Cleaned text content.
Requirement Extraction Agent (Enhanced with LLM):

Input: Cleaned text content.
Process: Uses an LLM (e.g., GPT-3.5 Turbo, Gemini) with careful prompting to:
Identify functional requirements.
Classify requirements (e.g., safety, performance, usability).
Extract key information related to each requirement (e.g., inputs, outputs, conditions).
Prompt Engineering is Key: You'll need to craft effective prompts to guide the LLM. For example:
"Extract the functional requirements from the following ADAS user manual text and present them in a structured format (JSON). Include the requirement ID, a concise description, the type of requirement (e.g., safety, performance), and any relevant inputs, outputs, and conditions.

Text: [Paste the ADAS manual text here]"
Output: Structured requirements (e.g., JSON).
Gherkin Generation Agent (LLM-Powered):

Input: Structured requirements.
Process: Uses an LLM with carefully designed prompts to generate Gherkin scenarios for each requirement.
Prompt Example:
"Generate Gherkin test scenarios for the following ADAS requirement:

Requirement: {Requirement JSON from previous step}

Focus on creating scenarios that cover positive and negative cases, boundary conditions, and error handling. Ensure the Gherkin is well-structured and follows best practices."
Output: Gherkin feature files.
Validation Agent (Optional):

Input: Generated Gherkin.
Process: Can use simpler rule-based checks or even another LLM to validate the generated Gherkin for syntax, completeness, and coverage.
Output: Validation report.
Orchestrator Agent: Manages workflow, data flow, and agent coordination.

Workflow:

The Document Processing Agent cleans the ADAS manual text.
The Orchestrator sends the cleaned text to the Requirement Extraction Agent.
The Requirement Extraction Agent uses the LLM with a well-crafted prompt to extract structured requirements.
The Orchestrator sends the structured requirements to the Gherkin Generation Agent.
The Gherkin Generation Agent uses the LLM with a specific prompt to generate Gherkin scenarios.
(Optional) The Validation Agent checks the generated Gherkin.
The Orchestrator collects the results and generates reports.
Key Improvements with Generative AI:

Improved Requirement Understanding: LLMs can better understand the nuances of natural language, leading to more accurate and complete requirement extraction.
More Natural Gherkin: LLMs can generate more human-like and readable Gherkin scenarios.
Handling Complexity: LLMs can handle more complex requirements and generate more varied test cases.
Reduced Manual Effort: Significantly reduces the need for manual rule creation and template design.
Implementation Details:

LLM API: Use an API like OpenAI's API (for GPT models) or Google's Vertex AI (for Gemini models).
Prompt Engineering: This is crucial. Experiment with different prompts to get the best results. Iterate and refine your prompts based on the output.
Data Storage: Use a database or JSON files to store the structured requirements and Gherkin scenarios.
Agent Framework (Optional but Recommended): Using an agent framework can help manage the complexity of multiple interacting agents.
Example (Conceptual Python with LLM API Call):

Python

import openai  # Or google.generativeai for Gemini

# ... (Document Processing Agent) ...

class RequirementExtractionAgent:
    def extract_requirements(self, text):
        response = openai.ChatCompletion.create( #Or Gemini API call
            model="gpt-3.5-turbo", #Or Gemini model
            messages=[
                {"role": "system", "content": "You are an expert in extracting functional requirements from technical documents."},
                {"role": "user", "content": f"Extract requirements:\n\n{text}"} #Improved prompt
            ]
        )
        requirements_json = response['choices'][0]['message']['content'] #Extract the JSON
        return json.loads(requirements_json) #Parse the JSON

# ... (Gherkin Generation Agent - similar structure with different prompt) ...
Challenges:

LLM Cost: Using LLM APIs can be expensive, especially for large documents.
Prompt Engineering: Requires careful design and experimentation.
Output Validation: While LLMs are good at generating text, they can still make mistakes. Validation is important.
Context Window Limits: LLMs have context window limits. For very large documents, you might need to process them in chunks.
By combining a multi-agent system with the power of generative AI, you can create a highly effective automated system for Gherkin test script generation, significantly reducing manual effort and improving test quality. Remember to focus on prompt engineering and validation to achieve the best results.

        else:
            print("Requirement extraction failed.")
    else:
        print(processed_text) #Print the error message

Key Improvements:

Error Handling: Added try...except blocks to handle file processing errors, JSON decoding errors, and OpenAI API errors. This makes the code much more robust.
Clearer Prompts: Improved the prompts to be more specific and provide better guidance to the LLM.
JSON Handling: Explicitly handles JSON parsing and includes error handling for invalid JSON responses from the LLM. Prints the raw LLM output on JSON errors for debugging.
Temperature Control: Set temperature=0.0 in the LLM calls for more deterministic output, which is generally better for test case generation.
File Handling: Reads the ADAS manual from a file, making it more practical. Added UTF-8 encoding to handle more character sets.
Main Block: Wrapped the main execution in if __name__ == "__main__": so the code is only executed when the script is run directly.
Formatted JSON Output: Prints the extracted requirements as formatted JSON for better readability.
Check for Processing Errors: The orchestrator checks for errors during document processing before proceeding.
API Key from Environment: Gets the OpenAI API key from the environment variable OPENAI_API_KEY. This is best practice for security.
To Run:

Install the OpenAI Python library: pip install openai
Set your OpenAI API key:
The best way is to set it as an environment variable:
On Linux/macOS: export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_actual_api_key"
On Windows: set OPENAI_API_KEY="your_actual_api_key"
Or, you can replace os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY") with your actual key in the code (but this is less secure).
Create an adas_manual.txt file: Put some sample ADAS manual text into this file. For example:
The system shall warn the driver if the vehicle deviates from its lane. The system shall apply the brakes if an imminent collision is detected. The system shall maintain a safe following distance.
Run the script: python your_script_name.py
This improved version is much more complete and robust. It addresses many of the potential issues and provides a more practical starting point for building your automated test generation system. Remember that prompt engineering is key to getting good results from the LLM. Experiment with different prompts to find what works best for your specific ADAS manual.
