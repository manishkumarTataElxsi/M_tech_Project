Multi-Agent System Approach for Automation of Behavior-Driven Development in Scenario-Based Verification of Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS) /Autonomous Driving Using Generative AI
Abstract:
The development of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and Autonomous Driving (AD) necessitates rigorous scenario-based verification to ensure safety and reliability. Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) facilitates collaboration between domain experts and engineers through natural language specifications. However, manual scenario generation is labor-intensive and prone to errors. This paper proposes a Multi-Agent System (MAS) approach to automate BDD in scenario-based verification for ADAS/AD. Our approach employs Generative AI-enabled agents to generate scenarios, each capturing domain-specific knowledge, and interactions. These agents collaborate with a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate precise, context-aware features and scenarios for each ADAS/AD feature, enabling efficient and scalable verification of ADAS functionalities. We focus on generating Gherkin scripts (.feature) and Python scripts (.py) for scenario-based verification, leveraging LLMs and prompt engineering with MAS. We evaluate the effectiveness of the MAS approach by demonstrating its applicability in real-world driving scenarios.
