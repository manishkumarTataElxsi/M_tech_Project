The growing complexity of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS)/Autonomous Driving (AD) technology requires robust testing and validation processes. The verification of safety and reliability of ADAS needs Scenario Based Testing (SBT), where real-world scenarios are simulated. Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) offers a structured, natural language approach to defining test scenarios, but its manual implementation remains time-consuming and error-prone. In this paper, we propose a Large Language Model (LLM)-based Multi-Agent System (MAS) approach to automate BDD in scenario-based verification of ADAS. This framework generates, translates and refines executable BDD test cases by leveraging LLMs and MAS. This system enhances efficiency by automating test scenario generation, reducing human effort, and improving adaptability to complex verification tasks. This approach is evaluated by simulation of BDD test cases which exhibit significant improvement in automation, scalability, and verification accuracy compared to traditional methods. This research highlights the potential of LLM based MAS in automation of BDD test cases in scenario-based testing for ADAS, which enables more robust and intelligent verification pipelines in the automotive industry.
