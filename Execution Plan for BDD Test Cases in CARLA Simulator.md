**Execution Plan for BDD Test Cases in CARLA Simulator**

This plan outlines the steps to execute the BDD test cases for the Active Park Assist (APA) feature within the CARLA simulator. The goal is to systematically test each scenario and record the results for analysis.

**1. Environment Setup**

*   **CARLA Simulator:**
    *   Install and configure the CARLA simulator (version 0.9.14 or later recommended).
    *   Ensure the simulator is running in a suitable environment (e.g., a town with parking spots).
    *   Set the simulation to run in synchronous mode for deterministic execution.
*   **Test Framework:**
    *   Use a BDD test framework (e.g., Behave, Cucumber) to define and execute the test cases.
    *   Implement a CARLA client to interact with the simulator from the test framework.
*   **Vehicle Configuration:**
    *   Spawn a vehicle equipped with the necessary sensors (e.g., ultrasonic sensors, cameras) for APA.
    *   Configure the vehicle's parameters (e.g., speed, steering limits) as needed for the test scenarios.

**2. Test Case Execution**

The following steps are repeated for each scenario in the BDD test suite.

*   **Scenario Setup:**
    *   Reset the simulation to a clean state.
    *   Position the vehicle according to the "given" conditions of the scenario.
    *   Set any necessary environment conditions (e.g., sensor status, presence of obstacles).
*   **Action Simulation:**
    *   Simulate the "when" conditions of the scenario using the CARLA client. This might involve:
        *   Sending commands to the vehicle (e.g., accelerate, brake, steer).
        *   Triggering events in the simulation (e.g., driver presses HMI button).
        *   Modifying the environment (e.g., introducing obstacles).
*   **Verification:**
    *   Verify the "then" conditions of the scenario by:
        *   Reading data from the vehicle's sensors and actuators.
        *   Querying the state of the simulation (e.g., HMI display, APA status).
        *   Asserting that the expected behavior is observed.
*   **Recording:**
    *   Start recording the simulation using CARLA's built-in recorder or an external screen recording tool.
    *   Capture screenshots at key moments during the scenario (e.g., when APA is activated, when a parking spot is detected, when the vehicle starts parking).
    *   Stop recording when the scenario is complete.
*   **Error Handling:**
    *   Wrap the scenario execution in a try-except block to catch any exceptions.
    *   If an exception occurs, log the error message and mark the scenario as failed.
    *   Ensure that the simulation is reset to a clean state before proceeding to the next scenario.

**3. Test Scenarios (Examples)**

Here are some examples of how the BDD test cases can be translated into executable code using a hypothetical CARLA client:

*   **Scenario: Activate APA via HMI button**

```python
# Given the vehicle is stationary
vehicle.stop()

# When the driver presses the APA button on the HMI
hmi.press_button("APA")

# Then the HMI should display parking options
assert hmi.display_contains("Parallel Parking", "Perpendicular Parking")
```

*   **Scenario: APA is not activated when sensors/cameras are faulty**

```python
# Given a sensor or camera is not working properly
sensor.set_faulty("camera_front")

# When the driver attempts to activate APA
hmi.press_button("APA")

# Then APA should not activate
assert apa.is_active() == False

# And the HMI should display an alert indicating the faulty sensor/camera
assert hmi.display_contains("Camera Front Fault")
```

*   **Scenario: Initiate parking spot search**

```python
# Given APA is activated
apa.activate()

# And the driver has selected parking preferences
hmi.select_option("Parallel Parking")
hmi.select_option("Right Side")

# When the vehicle speed is less than 7 mph
vehicle.set_speed(5)

# Then APA should initiate parking spot search
assert apa.is_searching() == True

# And the HMI should display a message directing the driver to drive slowly
assert hmi.display_contains("Drive Slowly to Search for Parking")
```

**4. Output Organization**

Create a folder named "APA\_Test\_Results" to store the simulation videos and screenshots. Within this folder, create subfolders for each feature. Inside each feature folder, create subfolders for each scenario.

*   **Folder Structure:**

```
APA_Test_Results/
    Active_Park_Assist_System_Activation/
        Activate_APA_via_HMI_button/
            video.mp4
            screenshot1.png
            screenshot2.png
        APA_is_not_activated_when_sensors_cameras_are_faulty/
            video.mp4
            screenshot1.png
            screenshot2.png
    Active_Park_Assist_Parking_Preference_Selection/
        Select_parallel_parking/
            video.mp4
            screenshot1.png
        ...
    ...
```

*   **File Naming:**
    *   Videos: `video.mp4`
    *   Screenshots: `screenshot1.png`, `screenshot2.png`, etc. (Capture screenshots at key moments in each scenario)

**5. Reporting**

Generate a test report summarizing the results of each scenario. The report should include:

*   Scenario name
*   Status (Pass/Fail)
*   Error message (if applicable)
*   Links to the simulation video and screenshots

**Note:** Since I cannot directly execute the tests and generate the output files, this plan provides a detailed guide on how to perform the tests and organize the results. The actual execution and file generation would need to be done using the CARLA simulator and a suitable test framework.
